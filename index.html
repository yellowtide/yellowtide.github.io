to see this document without automatic formatting.

Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, you can
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/morgan3d) these projects on GitHub
for $2 or just buy my [Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. 
Revenue from the book funds my open source projects.


Basic Formatting
=======================================================================================
Text formatting: 

    Source                               |     Result
-----------------------------------------|------------------------------
`**bold**`                               | **bold**
`__bold__`                               | __bold__
`*italic*`                               | *italic*
`_italic_`                               | _italic_
`~~strikethrough~~`                      | ~~strikethrough~~
<code>`inline code`</code>               | `inline code`
`[news](https://cbc.ca)`                 | [news](https://cbc.ca)
`https://casual-effects.com`             | https://casual-effects.com
`morgan@casual-effects.com`              | morgan@casual-effects.com
`5 kg/m^3`                               | 5 kg/m^3
`5 degrees`                              | 5 degrees
`x<sub>below</sub>`                      | x<sub>below</sub>
`<small>size</small>`                    | <small>size</small>
`<big>size</big>`                        | <big>size</big>

You can add CSS to change the styles. See the Custom Formatting section
for some examples.

Formatted text may **cross
lines** and be as small as **a** single character. It can _also
  be indented and
  split across lines_ simultaneously.

Markdeep intelligently does not apply bold or italic formatting to
math expressions such as x = 3 * y - 2 * z or WORDS_WITH_INTERNAL_UNDERSCORES.
It also protects HTML `<tags>` in code blocks from disappearing.

If you _want_ italics or bold inside of a word, for example in: SCUBA = <b>S</b>elf <b>C</b>ontained
<b>U</b>nderwater <b>B</b>reathing <b>A</b>pparatus, then just use HTML `<b>` and `<i>`
tags---a markdown syntax won't be any more readable in that case.

Exponents only work for positive and negative integers. For arbitrary exponents,
use LaTeX notation: `$x^y$` ==> $x^y$, or HTML tags: `x<sup>y</sup>` ==> x<sup>y</sup>.

Links
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many forms of implicit and explicit links:


         Source                            |   Result
-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
`[hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)`   | [hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)

`Section [lists]`                          | Section [lists]
`sec. [lists]`                             | sec. [lists]
`subsection [lists]`                       | subsection [lists]
`table [states]`                           | table [states]
`tbl. [states]`                            | tbl. [states]
`Table [states]`                           | Table [states]
`figure [robot]`                           | figure [robot]
`fig. [robot]`                             | fig. [robot]
`Figure [robot]`                           | Figure [robot]
`lst. [sort]`                              | lst. [sort]
`listing [sort]`                           | listing [sort]
`Listing [sort]`                           | Listing [sort]
`[New York Times][nyt]`                    | [New York Times][nyt]
`[Google][]`                               | [Google][]
`footnote [^syntax]`                       | footnote [^syntax]
`[#Kajiya86]`                              | [#Kajiya86]

Any section header name followed by "section", "subsection", or "sec." will automatically be
linked to that section. (The keyword "chapter" currently works but is unsupported and likely to
change to work differently with multi-file documents in the future.)

To link by number, use one of those key words followed by the section
name in brackets. This won't work if you use the actual word "section" _as the title of a
section_...but it would be unexpected to have a section named "section" in a real document
anyway.

You can also insert HTML anchor (`<a>`) tags to create arbitrary internal links.

When linking to a Markdeep document from another document, you can refer to sections
based on either a mangled version of their name or a fully-qualified version of that.
The mangling is URI encoding of the section name with spaces removed, in all lowercase.
For example, this section can be linked to as 
`features.md.html#links` or `features.md.html#basicformatting/links`.

**The easiest way to generate a link to a section is to simply
right-click (or ctrl-click) on that section header in the
browser. This will bring up a context menu that allows you to copy
either the internal Markdeep text of the link or the external HTML
code link.** While a hover would be more discoverable, I chose to use
the context menu so that this functionality would work well on touch 
screens, be easier to style for themes, and not affect layout.

Reference-style links include arbitrary formatted text in brackets
followed by a case-insensitive symbolic name that must be defined
elsewhere in the document:

- Example using a symbolic name: [New York Times][nyt]
- Example using the text as its own symbol: [Google][]

Put the definitions at a convenient location elsewhere in the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
    [nyt]: http://nytimes.com
    [google]: http://google.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdeep also supports footnotes, endnotes [^syntax], and citations
[#Kajiya86] using a similar syntax. The actual notes and bibliography
may be placed at the bottom of the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~none
    [#Kajiya86]: James T. Kajiya. 1986 ...

    [^syntax]: Endnotes look like ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple citations (but not footnotes) may be included within brackets:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~none
...the early Monte Carlo rendering methods [#Cook84, #Kajiya86].
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Regular links may also have attributes, for example,
[this link will directly download](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/robot.jpg download).

URLs in explicit links may be surrounded by optional `"` quotation `"` marks. If your URL
contains parentheses, then it _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks to make it unambigious:

- [a link with parens]("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")
- []("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")

URLs with various forms of special characters are handled well even without quotation marks:

- [hyperlinks to URLs with underscores](https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt)
- https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt

You can also use the CommonMark angle bracket syntax
`<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello>` ==>
<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello> provided that your URL only
contains lower-case letters. Otherwise the browser interprets it
as a tag and converts it to lowercase before Markdeep runs.

(SIGGRAPH '86)_, ACM, 143-150. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/15922.15902


[^syntax]: Endnotes look like reference-style links with an empty text
field. Endnotes may not contain multiple paragraphs (sorry, David
Foster Wallace), although they may refer to _other_ endnotes.

Lists
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A blank line or line ending in a colon must precede lists. Lists have lines that begin with a
number (which is not required to increment) and a period, or a bullet character (-, *, +). They
can also be nested. Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Monday
2. Tuesday
  1. Morning
  2. Afternoon
3. Wednesday
  - Bullets
  - Bullets
1. Thursday
  + Bullets
  + Bullets
1. Friday
  * Bullets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of lists and floating diagrams:
                                                   *****************************
1. Monday                                          *   A         B         C   *
2. Tuesday                                         *   *-------->o<------->o   *
  1. Morning                                       *   ^        / ^        |   *
  2. Afternoon                                     *   |       v   \       v   *
3. Wednesday                                       *   o----->o---->o<---->*   *
  - Bullets                                        *   D      E     F      G   *
  - Bullets                                        *****************************
4. Thursday
5. Friday


A list with just bullets:
- Bread
- Fish
- Milk
- Cheese


A  list containing a code block:

1. This is the first list item.

   ~~~~~~
   // This is a code block
   if (x > 0) printf("hello!\n");
   ~~~~~~
   
1. This is the second list item.


- Level 1
 - Level 2
  - Level 3
- Level 1 again


- 1
 - 1.a
  - 1.a.i
  - 1.a.ii
 - 1.b

Lists can also:

* Use asterisks
* Instead of
* Minus signs
* `or have code`
* *and* other formatting

or

+ Use plus
+ Signs


Lists with blank lines between the elements are formatted with more spacing. There's actually
nothing special about this...that's just the regular paragraph separator.


1. Here's a list with some large elements that I chose to format by putting a blank line
   between the elements to make them more visually distinguished.

2. That's necessary with paragraph-sized elements; otherwise the
   text would appear to run together into a wall of text!
    
   - You can also
   - Nest lists within lists with spaces


Lists that begin with a number other than 1 use that number as the start index. The subsequent
numbers are irrelevant and automatically replaced with ascending numbers:

6. A list that starts at six!
1. and just
1. keeps going...


Task Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the strikethrough syntax for task lists:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ~~completed~~
  1. ~~subtask~~
1. uncompleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which will format as:

1. ~~completed~~
  1. ~~subtask~~
1. uncompleted

or, use github or streamlined checkbox syntax for task lists :

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
github:
- [x] completed
  - [x] subtask
- [ ] uncompleted

streamlined:
[x] completed
  [x] subtask
[ ] uncompleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

github:
- [x] completed
  - [x] subtask
- [ ] uncompleted

streamlined:
[x] completed
  [x] subtask
[ ] uncompleted



Definition Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

    Multiple paragraphs are supported.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

    - Can also
    - Put lists
    - In definitions

Definition lists with short definitions are formatted more tersely:

Grapes
: Available in purple ("red") and green ("white") varieties.

Bananas
: Only yellow.


Schedule Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schedule lists contain titles that begin with a valid date. After the
title, arbitrary indented content appears, including lists, text, and
equations:

~~~~~~~~~~~~none
Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system
 
Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
                  ⋮

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the schedule is sufficiently long and dense, then a calendar preview
is shown before it. Entries in parenthesis with no further details
are formatted with a more subtle style.

Formatted schedule lists
look like:

Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system

Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
 
 _Plan for weekend overtime if we miss this milestone_
 
Wednesday Feb 24, 2016: Site Visit
 **Whole team vistits client**. Dress appropriately.

Friday Feb 26, 2016: Demo Milestone
 - Internal demonstrations for management
 - QA reports due

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed

Tuesday Mar 1, 2016: Code Freeze
 - Commit final features before this date
 - Only priority 1 fixes with issue tracking numbers
   after this point

Monday Mar 7, 2016: Beta

Wednesday Mar 16, 2016: Gold

Dates can be in any unambigous format that includes a month, day, and
four-digit year between 1000 and 2999, such as:

- 2001-03-01
- 1 Apr. 1999
- 4-07-1976
- February 16, 2016
- 2020 Jan. 15
- May 15th, 1982

The US date format MM/DD/YYYY is not supported because it is
ambiguous. The date may include the name of a day of the week
(e.g., Sunday). It will be replaced with the correct day.

When months are given by name, they must match the localization
settings.


Block Quotes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Email-style indenting creates a blockquote:

> This is an indented blockquote: Ut at felis diam. Aliquam massa odio, pharetra ut neque sed, commodo
> dignissim orci. Curabitur quis velit gravida, blandit diam nec,
> lacinia quam. Maecenas pharetra, velit in vestibulum auctor, diam
> ipsum suscipit arcu, non sodales orci nibh sit amet leo. Nulla dictum

Blockquotes formatted in the style of an actual quotation receive
special treatment for fancy quoting:

> "You want to make it seem alive and effortless and fun, but that's an
> art that took me 25 years to really learn. I wanted to do it very much
> 25 years ago, but I didn't know how."
>
>      -- David O. Russell, director of American Hustle

Page Breaks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To support other markdown conventions, `\pagebreak` and `\newpage` will insert a page break in
a document when printed or converted to PDF. You can also use a pattern of a series of five `+`
signs on their own line, which will form a horizontal rule on screen and a new page when
printed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make top-level section headers also force page breaks, add the following to your
document or CSS file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>.md h1, .md .nonumberh1 {page-break-before:always}</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Images
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's no natural way to embed an image into a document that is also readable as plain
text. Markdeep follows markdown's somewhat reasonable syntax.  The source

`      ![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

becomes:

![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Optional labels may be applied:

`      ![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Any text after the URL is used as HTML attributes. If the attributes
include width or height specifications, then the image is linked to
the original.

````
![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")
````

![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Really long captions are justified, not centered. This happens 
  automatically when the caption spans multiple lines. You can also use custom CSS to 
  change the formatting of captions.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Captions may contain [links](https://casual-effects.com), but not other images.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Floating robot with a large caption.](robot.jpg width="20%") If the image is embedded in a
paragraph and has a caption, then it floats right and any width
specification is propagated to the full captioned image, for example, 
the image to the right of this paragraph. Use a space as your caption
if you want this behavior but don't actually want a visible caption.

You can also just use a raw HTML `<img>` tag: 

`       <img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2">`

<img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2">

Captionless images work as well. Source `![](robot.jpg)` becomes:

![](robot.jpg)

Images are centered if they appear in their own paragraph block and
inlined otherwise. Grids of images are recognized and laid out as
grids using HTML tables:


![1](robot.jpg width=100) ![2](robot.jpg width=100) ![3](robot.jpg width=100)
![4](robot.jpg width=100) ![5](robot.jpg width=100) ![This image has a<br>long caption](robot.jpg width=100)

Images may be shown pixel-perfect under zoom (which is good for computer graphics/computer
vision results and pixel art) by attaching the `pixel` CSS class:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![Pixel perfect image](invader.png width=150px class=pixel)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![Pixel perfect image](invader.png width=150px class=pixel)


Reference Images
----------------------------------------------------------------

Markdeep introduces a new feature called "reference images". These have several nice properties:

* Put long image URLs elsewhere in the document for clarity
* Indirection so that multiple images can reference a symbolic URL
* Embed [base64 encoded images as data URIs](https://www.base64-image.de/) directly in a Markdeep text file


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![This is a base64 embedded reference image][hasselhoff.png]

<!-- This can appear anywhere in the document. I recommend putting it at the bottom.  -->
[hasselhoff.png]: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

![This is a base64 embedded reference image][hasselhoff.png]

The syntax is the same as CommonMark reference _links_, just with square brackets. 
You can use all of the Markdeep image features with reference images, including 
image grids, floating images, and images with attributes.

Videos
----------------------------------------------------------------

Video file extensions are automatically detected and will embed a small video
player:

     ![A video](rocket.mp4)


URLs for Youtube and Vimeo videos will also automatically embed a video player:

![State Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgPMyvZMBY0)

![Figure [fig:boy]: The Boy with a Camera For a Face](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/151493973)

URLs for images may be surrounded in optional `"` quotation `"` marks. If your URL contains
parentheses, then it _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks to make it unambigious. 

Recall that URLs are not permitted to contain spaces (by their specification), so to embed
a local image whose filename has a space, either rename the file or replace the spaces
with `%20` in the URL version of the name.


Audio
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MP3, WAV, OGG, etc. audio for music and podcasts are supported using the same
syntax as for images and video:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
![The Personal Best CBC Podcast](https://podcast-a.akamaihd.net/mp3/podcasts/personalbest-GRHHTnR3-20180415.mp3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates:

![The Personal Best CBC Podcast](https://podcast-a.akamaihd.net/mp3/podcasts/personalbest-GRHHTnR3-20180415.mp3)



Symbol Substitutions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markdeep converts `<->`, `<==>`, `->`, `-->`, `<-`, `<--`, `==>`, and `<==` to arrows if they
aren't in a code block or latex expression and are surrounded by whitespace. Examples:

- if this ==> then that
- here <== there
- this <==> that
- A <- B
- X -> Y
- back <-> forth
- long --> way
- back <-- there

Two or three minus signs are converted to an em dash--like that.

An "x" between numbers, such as 1920x1080 or 3 x 4 x 6, will be
converted to the times symbol.

Negative numbers, such as -5 and minus signs between numbers such as 
2 - 1, will have a minus sign instead of a hyphen.

Degrees are reformatted to the degree symbol:

- Cold, 37-degree F water.
- A 45-degree angle.
- A right angle's measure is 90 degrees. 

It doesn't reformat the word "degree" when not following digits:

- Don't give me the third degree!
- I have two degrees from MIT.

"Smart quotes" are applied for double-quote marks based on position
relative to whitespace:

"a" b c

a "b" c

a b "c"

a "b!" c

a "b," c

a "b". C

a, "b" c

a---"b"---c

a ("b") c

"error" ==> "correction"

Inch or minute markers such as 3' 9" are not converted. Quotation
marks in <span style="color:#F00">HTML attributes</span> and
in code blocks, e.g., `var x = "hello world"`, are not converted.


Admonitions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admonitions are small break-out boxes with notes, tips, warnings, etc. for the reader. They
begin with a title line of a pattern of three exclaimation marks, an optional CSS class, and an
optional title. All following lines that are indented at least three spaces are included in the
body, which may include multiple paragraphs.

The default stylesheet provides classes for "note" (default), "tip", "warning", and "error".
These are case insensitive and ignore any colon after the CSS class. Here are some examples:

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` none
!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.


Fenced Code Blocks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set off large blocks of code using equal-length strings of tilde `~`
or back-tick <code>`</code> characters. Each produces a different CSS
class so that they can be styled differently. 

By default, tilde blocks have lines before and after them and are
inset for use as code listings instead of large inline code
blocks. Both styles receive syntax coloring and automatic programming
language detection.

You can override automatic programming language detection by putting
the name of the language immediately following the first fence. The
supported languages are (capitalization ignored):

`bash cs C# cpp C++ css coffeescript html XML http JSON java JavaScript Makefile`
`markdown objectivec Objective-C PHP perl python ruby shell armasm glsl go haskell`
`kotlin lisp lua matlab R rust scheme swift tex typescript yaml PyxlScript none`

You can specify a custom CSS class for a code block by placing its
name after the language name.

<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C</code>
void insertion_sort(int data[], int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
       ...
    }
}
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code>
</pre>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
void insertion_sort(int data[], int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
       ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Alternative back-tick markup:

````````````````````````````````````
def insertionSort(data):
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        j = i;

        while (j > 0) and (data[j] < data[j - 1]):
            temp = data[j]
            data[j] = data[j - 1]
            data[j] = temp
            --j
````````````````````````````````````

### HTML and LaTeX Blocks

You can even have HTML in a code block:

<!-- Markdeep: --><style class="fallback">body{visibility:hidden;white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}</style><script src="markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script src="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>window.alreadyProcessedMarkdeep||(document.body.style.visibility="visible")</script>
