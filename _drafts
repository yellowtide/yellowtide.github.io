                      **Markdeep Feature Demo**
                           Morgan McGuire

This demonstration documents the features of
[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep) and acts as a test for
it.  Markdeep is a text formatting syntax that extends Markdown, and a
Javascript program for making it work in browsers. The two most
powerful features are its ability to run in any **web browser** on the
client side and the inclusion of **diagrams**.

[Click here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat)
to see this document without automatic formatting.

Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, you can
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/morgan3d) these projects on GitHub
for $2 or just buy my [Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. 
Revenue from the book funds my open source projects.
